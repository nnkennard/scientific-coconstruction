        "The paper considers the problem of representation learning of actions, i.e., learning a decomposition of action-value function in multidimensional action spaces using hypergraphs.",

        "The choice of mixing function appears to be dependent on the problem -- for instance, it could be an universal mixer such as a neural  network or it could be a simple summation.",
        "The key impact of this architecture could be in the bandit problem setting with very large action spaces.",

        "Does this mean that you are overfitting in terms of creating newer edges that dont exist?",
        "Is it too fine-grained of a representation?",
        "Some speculation could certainly improve the paper."

        "The authors clarified the presentation, gave a nuanced response to my concerns about the relative scalability, and promised to discuss the relationship to the actions-in architecture in the final version (it's not as central as I first thought given the limited role played by universal mixers).",

        "This is an interesting approach, but there are presentation and experimental issues preventing me from endorsing its publication.",
        "Currently the presentation obscures some of the limitations of the method.",
        "Not until the experiments is it revealed that the method (in its current state) is only applicable to tasks with finite action spaces.",
        "Most tasks typically considered as having multiple action dimensions are continuous control tasks, so this is unexpected given the motivation.",
        "Not knowing this up front also hurts the clarity of the paper e.g.",
        "Figure 1b mentions outputting all possible actions, which is only coherent in the context of this finite cardinality restriction.",
        "Now, I'm not saying that not handling continuous action spaces is necessary (your results on discretized continuous action tasks are impressive), just that you should be more up front with this fact.",
        "A second hidden limitation has to do with your method's scaling.",
        "If I understand your method correctly, to compute the maximum action-value you have execute the hyper-graph and mixer repeatedly, once for each possible action.",
        "This is in stark contrast to the standard actions-out architecture popularized by DQN -- a single forward pass compute all action-values.",
        "You (correctly) point out that both your method and DQN grow exponentially in the number of action dimensions, but in practice the latter will scale much better as it just amounts to a larger dimension matmul.",
        "Again, this limitation need not be overcome, but it should be mentioned.",
        "On the experimental front, there is a serious baseline missing.",
        "Prior to DQN, many RL (with function approximation) papers treated the action as an input.",
        "Indeed, the only reason this is less common these days is due to the run-time issue discussed above.",
        "Treating the action as an input corresponds to only using the highest order hyper-graph (since the action contains all action dimensions), making that special case not a contribution of this paper.",
        "Thus, comparing against this case would be necessary to show that this method improves upon prior work.",
        "Additionally comparing against more recent approaches (e.g. auto-regressive processing of action dimensions) would further strengthen the paper, but this is of less importance in my opinion."
